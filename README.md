# Transaction Scheduling
For different media/content transactions, latency requirements can be quite different. It's probably fine if a singer is paid a day or even a month after her song is streamed. It does not have to be in real time. Tipping may be different because tippers may want to see instant effect like on Steemit. 

We conduct some preliminary research in real-time scheduling of packets in networks and simulation results demonstrate our novel scheduling algorithm outperforms others significantly. We are currently investigating how to leverage this promising result to schedule transactions in the context of ContentBox.
